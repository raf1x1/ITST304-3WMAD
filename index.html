          <h1 >GOAL 5</h1>
          <br><br/>
          <p>Gender equality is not only a fundamental human right, but a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world. There has been progress over the last decades, but the world is not on track to achieve gender equality by 2030.
            <br><br/>
            Women and girls represent half of the worldâ€™s population and therefore also half of its potential. But gender inequality persists everywhere and stagnates social progress.
            On average, women in the labor market still earn 23 percent less than men globally and women spend about three times as many hours in unpaid domestic and care work as men.
            <br><br/>
            Sexual violence and exploitation, the unequal division of unpaid care and domestic work, and discrimination in public office, all remain huge barriers. All these areas of inequality have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic: there has been a surge in reports of sexual violence, women have taken on more care work due to school closures, and 70% of health and social workers globally are women.
            <br><br/>
            At the current rate, it will take an estimated 300 years to end child marriage, 286 years to close gaps in legal protection and remove discriminatory laws, 140 years for women to be represented equally in positions of power and leadership in the workplace, and 47 years to achieve equal representation in national parliaments.
            <br><br/>
            Political leadership, investments and comprehensive policy reforms are needed to dismantle systemic barriers to achieving Goal 5 Gender equality is a cross-cutting objective and must be a key focus of national policies, budgets and institutions.</p>

          <h3>ARE THERE ANY OTHER GENDER-RELATED
            CHALLENGES?</h3>
          <p>
            Yes. Worldwide, nearly half of married women
            lack decision-making power over their sexual
            and reproductive health and rights. 35 per
            cent of women between 15-49 years of age
            have experienced physical and/ or sexual
            intimate partner violence or non-partner
            sexual violence.1 in 3 girls aged 15-19 have
            experienced some form of female genital
            mutilation/cutting in the 30 countries in Africa
            and the Middle East, where the harmful
            practice is most common with a high risk of
            prolonged bleeding, infection (including HIV),
            childbirth complications, infertility and death.
            This type of violence doesn't just harm
            individual women and girls; it also
            undermines their overall quality of life and
            hinders their active involvement in society.

          <h3>WHY SHOULD GENDER EQUALITY MATTER
            TO ME?
            </h3>
          <p>
            Regardless of where you live in, gender equality
            is a fundamental human right. Advancing
            gender equality is critical to all areas of a
            healthy society, from reducing
            poverty to promoting the health, education,
            protection and the well-being of girls and boys
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="course-col">
          <h3>WHAT CAN WE DO?</h3>
          <p>
            If you are a girl, you can stay in school, help
            empower your female classmates to do the
            same and fight for your right to access sexual
            and reproductive health services. If you are a
            woman, you can address unconscious biases
            and implicit associations that form an
            unintended and often an invisible barrier to
            equal opportunity.
            If you are a man or a boy, you can work
            alongside women and girls to achieve gender
            equality and embrace healthy, respectful
            relationships.
